## **REAL-TIME CHAT APPLICATION**  

THIS IS A REAL-TIME CHAT APPLICATION BUILT USING VUE.JS, WEBSOCKETS, HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT. IT ALLOWS USERS TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES INSTANTLY, PROVIDING A SEAMLESS CHATTING EXPERIENCE SIMILAR TO MESSAGING APPS LIKE WHATSAPP. THE INTERFACE IS DESIGNED TO BE SIMPLE, RESPONSIVE, AND USER-FRIENDLY.  

### WORKING OF THE APPLICATION 
- THE HOMEPAGE DIRECTLY OPENS THE CHAT INTERFACE.  
- USERS CAN TYPE MESSAGES IN THE INPUT BOX AND SEND THEM BY PRESSING THE ENTER KEY OR CLICKING THE SEND BUTTON.  
- SENT MESSAGES APPEAR IN GREEN CHAT BUBBLES, WHILE RECEIVED MESSAGES APPEAR IN WHITE CHAT BUBBLES.  
- THE WEBSOCKET SERVER ENSURES THAT MESSAGES ARE INSTANTLY DELIVERED TO ALL CONNECTED USERS.  
- THE CHAT BOX AUTOMATICALLY SCROLLS DOWN TO THE LATEST MESSAGE.  
- THE DESIGN IS INSPIRED BY MODERN MESSAGING APPS, FEATURING A CLEAN LAYOUT WITH A HEADER SECTION, MESSAGE DISPLAY AREA, AND INPUT SECTION.  

### TECHNOLOGY USED 
- **HTML (INDEX.HTML)** → DEFINES THE STRUCTURE OF THE CHAT INTERFACE, INCLUDING MESSAGE DISPLAY AND INPUT ELEMENTS.  
- **CSS (STYLE.CSS)** → ENHANCES THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHAT BOX WITH COLORS, ANIMATIONS, AND A MOBILE-FRIENDLY DESIGN.  
- **VUE.JS (SCRIPT.JS)** → MANAGES REAL-TIME UPDATES, MESSAGE HANDLING, AND UI INTERACTIONS.  
- **WEBSOCKETS (SERVER.JS)** → ENABLES INSTANT MESSAGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN USERS BY KEEPING AN OPEN CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND SERVER.
